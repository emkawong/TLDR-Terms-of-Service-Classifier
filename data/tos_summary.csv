<strong>What are cookies?</strong>
</p>
<p>A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access a website.
The text file is then sent back to our server each time your browser requests a page from the server.
This enables us to operate the site more effectively and load the site so that it reflects your personal preferences, based on your previous browsing on Virgin.com as well as keywords we may be able to gather from URLs of other webpages from which you accessed Virgin.com.
Cookies can also allow us to do various other things, as explained below.</p>
<p>
<strong>What cookies do we use?</strong>
</p>
<p>When you visit Virgin.com, the following types of cookies may be downloaded to your device:</p>
<p>
<strong>Analytical and Performance Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use analytics service providers for website traffic analysis and reporting.
Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about the use of Virgin.com by using cookies.
They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how often visitors return to the site, how long they stay and how visitors move around our site when they are using it.
This helps us to improve the way our site works, for example, it helps users to find what they are looking for easily.
The information generated relating to the site may be used to create reports about the use of the site and the analytics service provider will store this information.</p>

We will use this information to try and make our site and other sites that you visit more relevant to your interests.
We may also share this information with others, such as other Virgin companies and carefully selected third parties, for this purpose.</p>
<p>We work with technology partners to support our website and to provide you with relevant information about the products and services of other Virgin companies both on Virgin.com and on affiliated sites or sites within the advertising networks we work with.
We may use cookies on our site to help us to place relevant Virgin company advertising on third party websites when you visit those sites.

Some cookies that we use are necessary for our site to function properly and to enable you to move around the site and use its features.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>Because Virgin and Richard have a strong presence on various social networks, we try and make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks.
We add buttons to allow people to easily share to those networks.
We also use Facebook to power the commenting functionality on the site.
When we include these social 'plugins', it gives those sites the flexibility to use their own cookies.
They can't read any cookies we set from Virgin.com, and we can't read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of Virgin.com, and it also lets them know whether you're logged into their site.
For example, if you're logged in to Facebook, read a post by Richard Branson and want to make a comment, you can do that straight away without having to log in again - we never know whether you're logged in or not, as you communicate directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our site.</p>
<p>Other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control.
These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.</p>

"Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services.
They are widely used to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and assist with service or advertising personalization.</p>
<p>Cookies are not the only types of technology that enable this functionality.
we also use other, similar types of technologies.
See below for more information and examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>What are advertising identifiers?</strong>
<p>Advertising identifiers are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the ""Identifier for Advertisers"" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the ""Google Advertising ID"" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.
Like cookies, advertising identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Why does Netflix use cookies and advertising identifiers?</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service.
For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them.
They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.</li>
<li>
<strong>Performance and functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience with Netflix.
For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up).
We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research.
Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.</li>
<li>
<strong>Advertising cookies and advertising identifiers:</strong> These cookies and advertising identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you.
These types of ads are called ""interest-based advertising."" Many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>How can I exercise choice regarding cookies and advertising identifiers?</strong>
<p>For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here.</p>
<p>To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with an advertising identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under ""privacy"" or ""ads"" in your device's settings).
You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.</p>
<p>Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</li>
<li>In Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)</li>
<li>In Canada: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC)</li>
</ul>
<p>At this time, we do not respond to Web browser ""do not track"" signals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>How Does Netflix use Web Beacons and other Technologies?</strong>
<p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies.
We and our Service Providers may use them for similar purposes as cookies, such as to understand and enhance the use of our service, improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and understand interactions with our marketing (including email and online ads on third party sites).
Because web beacons often work in conjunction with cookies, in many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.</p>
<p>We use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL).
Like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device.
We may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service.
There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding these technologies.
For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area.
see your browser's help function or support area to learn more.
Other technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.",Cookies are required.
"Unfortunately, no measures can be guaranteed to provide 100% security.
Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.</p>",No liability is accepted for improper access to your personal information.
"Netflix may, from time to time, change these Terms of Use.
Such revisions shall be effective immediately.
provided however, for existing members, such revisions shall, unless otherwise stated, be effective 30 days after posting.","Terms may be changed any time at their discretion, without notice to the user"
"We also use cookies, as well as advertising identifiers, to learn more about our users and their likely interests, and to deliver and tailor marketing or advertising.",Personal info is used for advertising.
"We disclose your information for certain purposes and to third parties, as described below","Netflix reserve the right to disclose personal info, no notification."
