<strong>What are cookies?</strong>
</p>
<p>A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access a website.
The text file is then sent back to our server each time your browser requests a page from the server.
This enables us to operate the site more effectively and load the site so that it reflects your personal preferences, based on your previous browsing on Virgin.com as well as keywords we may be able to gather from URLs of other webpages from which you accessed Virgin.com.
Cookies can also allow us to do various other things, as explained below.</p>
<p>
<strong>What cookies do we use?</strong>
</p>
<p>When you visit Virgin.com, the following types of cookies may be downloaded to your device:</p>
<p>
<strong>Analytical and Performance Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use analytics service providers for website traffic analysis and reporting.
Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about the use of Virgin.com by using cookies.
They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how often visitors return to the site, how long they stay and how visitors move around our site when they are using it.
This helps us to improve the way our site works, for example, it helps users to find what they are looking for easily.
The information generated relating to the site may be used to create reports about the use of the site and the analytics service provider will store this information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Advertising and Targeting Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>These cookies record your visit to Virgin.com, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed to other sites.
We will use this information to try and make our site and other sites that you visit more relevant to your interests.
We may also share this information with others, such as other Virgin companies and carefully selected third parties, for this purpose.</p>
<p>We work with technology partners to support our website and to provide you with relevant information about the products and services of other Virgin companies both on Virgin.com and on affiliated sites or sites within the advertising networks we work with.
We may use cookies on our site to help us to place relevant Virgin company advertising on third party websites when you visit those sites.
If you are not happy for us to do this, please see the section of this policy titled “How do I turn cookies off?” below.</p>
<p>
<strong>Functionality Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use functional cookies that allow us to remember choices you have made on the site so as to provide you with a more enhanced user experience by delivering content specific to your interests.</p>
<p>
<strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>These are cookies that are required for the administration and operation of our site.
Some cookies that we use are necessary for our site to function properly and to enable you to move around the site and use its features.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>Because Virgin and Richard have a strong presence on various social networks, we try and make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks.
We add buttons to allow people to easily share to those networks.
We also use Facebook to power the commenting functionality on the site.
When we include these social 'plugins', it gives those sites the flexibility to use their own cookies.
They can't read any cookies we set from Virgin.com, and we can't read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of Virgin.com, and it also lets them know whether you're logged into their site.
For example, if you're logged in to Facebook, read a post by Richard Branson and want to make a comment, you can do that straight away without having to log in again - we never know whether you're logged in or not, as you communicate directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our site.</p>
<p>Other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control.
These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.</p>

You have control over your personal data and how it is collected, used, and shared.
For example, you have a right to:</p>

<li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a ""data subject access request"").
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to confirm that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
<li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
<li>Request erasure of your personal data via&nbsp;https://inrupt.net/account/delete.
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
Please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
<li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
<li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data.
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
<li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
<li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.&nbsp;If you do not want to receive promotional or other e-mail from us, you can remove yourself from our mailing lists.</li>

<strong>What are advertising identifiers?</strong>
<p>Advertising identifiers are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the ""Identifier for Advertisers"" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the ""Google Advertising ID"" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.
Like cookies, advertising identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Why does Netflix use cookies and advertising identifiers?</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service.
For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them.
They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.</li>
<li>
<strong>Performance and functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience with Netflix.
For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up).
We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research.
Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.</li>
<li>
<strong>Advertising cookies and advertising identifiers:</strong> These cookies and advertising identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you.
These types of ads are called ""interest-based advertising."" Many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>How can I exercise choice regarding cookies and advertising identifiers?</strong>
<p>For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here.</p>
<p>To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with an advertising identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under ""privacy"" or ""ads"" in your device's settings).
You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.</p>
<p>Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</li>
<li>In Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)</li>
<li>In Canada: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC)</li>

<strong>How Does Netflix use Web Beacons and other Technologies?</strong>
<p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies.
We and our Service Providers may use them for similar purposes as cookies, such as to understand and enhance the use of our service, improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and understand interactions with our marketing (including email and online ads on third party sites).
Because web beacons often work in conjunction with cookies, in many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.</p>
<p>We use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL).
Like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device.
We may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service.
There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding these technologies.
For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area.
see your browser's help function or support area to learn more.
Other technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.",netflix,Cookies are required.,True,This service requires first-party cookies,neutral,,10,"This is probably more of a functional issue than a privacy issue.

<ul>
<li>
<b>Service Providers:</b> We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.
If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under instruction from us, including abiding by policies and procedures designed to protect your information.</li>
<li>
<b>Trello Partners:</b> We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, support and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services, including the Atlassian global partner network.<sup>7</sup> We may share your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations.
We may also share information with these third parties where you have agreed to that sharing, like when you agree to us sharing your information with a Trello Expert for support-related questions.</li>
<li>
<b>Third-Party apps:</b> You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by enabling third party apps like Power-Ups within the Services.
Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps.
If you are an administrator or contact listed on an account, we share your details with the third-party app provider upon installation.
Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices.
If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please disable the app.</li>

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

<b>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws.
Enforcement of Our Rights:</b> In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Trello, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.
